          <h2 className="title apple is-4">Is Apple Care Worth it?</h2>
          <p><strong>About AppleCare</strong></p>
          <p>iPhone hardware has a 1-year limited warranty. 
            To get your iPhone screen repaired or other accidental damage related repairs done in San Francisco or any other area where Apple has presence, you need extended warranty coverage. 
            Apple has AppleCare+, an extended warranty, and technical support service plan. 
            AppleCare+ plan can be bought when buying your iPhone or within 60 days of purchasing an iPhone.</p>
          <h3 className="title applecare is-4">AppleCare iPhone repair cost for different iPhones</h3>
          <p>AppleCare costs vary depending on the iPhone model. Here’s a summary of the cost of coverage for you to decide if AppleCare is worth it.</p>
          <ul className="appleprice">
            <li>I. AppleCare+ <strong>costs $199</strong> for <strong>iPhone 7 or 8</strong></li>
            <li>II. AppleCare+ <strong>cost $229</strong> for <strong>iPhone 11, XR, 8 plus, or 7 plus</strong></li>
            <li>III. Apple Care+ <strong>cost $269</strong> for <strong> iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max, XS, or XS max</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>What’s more, AppleCare+ coverage only covers a maximum of two accidental damage incidents every two years. Given phone screen damage is the most common type of phone damage, buying AppleCare+ doesn’t offer ultimate protection from expensive iPhone screen repair costs if you have more than two incidents in 24 months. Furthermore, every incident is subjected to service fees and applicable tax, and you have to endure long waiting times.</p>
          <h4 className="title iphonescreen is-4">What about iPhone screen repair costs without AppleCare?</h4>
          <p>If you damage your iPhone screen, but you don't have AppleCare coverage, the cost of repairs is much higher. Apple will charge you the following to repair your iPhone screen, depending on your phone model.</p>
          <ul className="price">
            <li><strong>$329</strong> to repair <strong>iPhone XS Max or iPhone 11 Pro Max</strong></li>
            <li><strong>$279</strong> to repair <strong>iPhones X, XS, or 11 pro</strong></li>
            <li><strong>$199</strong> to repair <strong>iPhones 11 or XR</strong></li>
            <li><strong>$169</strong> to repair <strong>iPhones 6s Plus, 7 Plus or 8 Plus</strong></li>
            <li><strong>$149</strong> to repair <strong>iPhones 6 Plus, 6s, 8 or 7</strong></li>
            <li><strong>$129</strong> to repair <strong>iPhone 6</strong></li>
          </ul>
